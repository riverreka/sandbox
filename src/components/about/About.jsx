I loved the way of their thinking and later they started to introduce us to the basics of algorythms and data structures. Since then I improved myself and lately graduated at School of Applied Technology where I was seleced from more than 1500 applicants. Now I am eager to use my knowledge in real projects and become a valuable part of a developer team.",

She displayed a level of analytical thought that has been very useful in our projects. Her skills are truly phenomenal, with wide-ranging intellect. She is ready to assume a job position and possesses the self-motivation to successfully create and execute the tasks required. Please let me know if I can provide any more information to strengthen her candidacy. She has a very special spark, and I trust she will go far in making every working place a better company.",
